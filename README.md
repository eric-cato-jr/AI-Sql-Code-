# GenAI SQL Code Improvement

This project demonstrates how AI-generated SQL code can be reviewed, refactored, and improved to meet real-world database standards. Rather than focusing on live execution, the emphasis is on correctness, clarity, and maintainability of SQL logic.

The project showcases my ability to evaluate GenAI-generated code, identify weaknesses, and apply best practices to produce clean, reliable SQL suitable for production environments.

---

## Project Focus

- Reviewing AI-generated SQL stored procedures and triggers
- Improving query correctness and readability
- Applying SQL best practices for joins, parameter usage, and formatting
- Enhancing maintainability through comments and structured logic
- Demonstrating critical evaluation of GenAI output rather than blind usage

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Understanding of **stored procedures** and parameterized queries
- Proper use of **INNER JOIN** instead of implicit joins
- Avoidance of `SELECT *` in favor of targeted column selection
- Use of **triggers** to enforce business rules automatically
- Ability to refactor and document SQL logic clearly
- Awareness of the limitations of AI-generated code

---

## Technologies Used

- SQL (Microsoft SQL Server syntax)
- Stored Procedures
- Triggers
- GenAI-assisted development workflows

---

## Repository Contents

- `ai_sql_code_refactoring.sql`  
  Contains both AI-generated SQL examples and improved versions with detailed comments explaining the changes and reasoning behind them.

## Notes

This project focuses on SQL logic review and improvement rather than database deployment. It reflects how AI-generated code can be safely and effectively adapted for real-world use without exposing database schemas or data.
